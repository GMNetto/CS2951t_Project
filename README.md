###Autoencoder for object classes in Faster-RCNN 

The python code for faster RCNN is available [here](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn).

This repository constains a python extension for Faster-RCNN to train an autoencoder for object classes. It uses the datasets already available in the implementation.
The original implementation of the autoencoder for neural networks can be found [here](https://github.com/kevinlin311tw/caffe-cvprw15)
